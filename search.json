    "title": "Does Balanced Scoring Lead to Success in the Big East?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Big East is widely regarded as one of the most competitive conferences in all of college basketball. With powerhouses like UCONN and Villanova winning the NCAA tournament in 4 of the last 8 years, the conference’s dominance is clear. A common question within the Big East revolves around the impact of scoring balance: do teams with more balanced scoring tend to perform better than those relying on one or two star players?\nThe Big East had multiple players go both in the first and second rounds of the 2024 NBA Draft, but let us see how those players contributed to their team while at the collegiate level. The graph below shows how many players averaged double digit points and for which team they played.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = team_double_digit_count,\n    aes(x = Team, y = Players_in_double_digits),\n    stat = \"identity\",\n    fill = \"lightblue\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"UCONN Dominates Once Again\",\n    subtitle = \"Dan Hurley's squad is filled with stars\",\n    x = \"School\",\n    y = \"Players Averaging Double Digits\",\n    caption = \"Source: sports-reference.com | By: Jack Beelman\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = \"black\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"lightgray\", color = \"black\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is no surprise that UCONN, the back-to-back National Champions, stands out with five players averaging double-digit points throughout the 2023-2024 season. Teams like Creighton and Marquette also boasted strong performances, each with four double-digit scorers. In contrast, teams such as Butler and St. John’s faced challenges despite a similar scoring balance.\nNow how do these players effect the overall winning percentage of their team? That is what the graph below tell us. We know the relationship between offensive depth and team success is clear. The variables in the data hint at many other contributing factors, like defensive prowess and team chemistry. This helps us understand what drives success beyond just scoring.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(\n    data = team_performance_clean,\n    aes(x = Players_in_double_digits, y = win_percentage, group = 1),\n    color = \"blue\",\n    linewidth = 0.8\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = team_performance_clean,\n    aes(x = Players_in_double_digits, y = win_percentage),\n    color = \"blue\",\n    size = 4\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = team_performance_clean,\n    aes(x = Players_in_double_digits, y = win_percentage, label = Team),\n    box.padding = 0.5\n  ) +\n  geom_hline(\n    yintercept = mean(team_performance_clean$win_percentage),\n    color = \"red\",\n    linetype = \"dashed\"\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n    \"text\",\n    x = 2,\n    y = mean(team_performance_clean$win_percentage) + 0.02,\n    label = \"Avg Win%\",\n    color = \"red\",\n    fontface = \"italic\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Scoring in double figures does wonders\",\n    subtitle = \"UCONN once again is in territory of their own\",\n    x = \"Number of Players Scoring in Double Digits\",\n    y = \"Win Percentage (%)\",\n    caption = \"Source: sports-reference.com | By: Jack Beelman\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again one of these is not like the rest. UCONN is by far the best representation to answer the question we initially asked. Having five players all scoring over 10 points a game definitely helps contribute to the overall team’s success and winning percentage. However, Butler seems to be in a surprising spot considering they had the same amount of double digit scorers as Creighton, Marquette, and St. Johns, but fell below the average win percentage in the Big East.\nAnother conference that is highly proclaimed and is home to the runner-up of the National Championship was the Big 10 Conference. Purdue stood out from the rest, but with 5 other teams that made the NCAA Tournament, the Big 10 in its own right was one of the strongest conferences in all of college basketball in the 2023-2024 season. The trends highlight how certain conferences consistently produce stronger teams, while others show great variability.\nThe graph below shows us how in comparison each team’s winning percentage in the Big East compared to the Big 10.\n\n\nCode\n  ggplot() +\n    geom_line(\n      data = combined_team_stats,\n      aes(x = Team, y = win_percentage, color = Conference, group = 1),\n      linewidth = 1.5\n    ) +\n    geom_point(\n      data = combined_team_stats,\n      aes(x = Team, y = win_percentage, color = Conference),\n      size = 4\n    ) +\n    labs(\n      title = \"UCONN and Purdue dominated the rest of the field\", \n      subtitle = \"The Huskies and Boilermakers were meant to meet in the final\",\n      x = \"Team\",\n      y = \"Win Percentage (%)\",\n      caption = \"Source: sports-reference.com | By: Jack Beelman\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0),\n      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14),\n      axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n      plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe comparison highlights the unique identity of each conference. The Big East thrives on unpredictability and moments of absurdness from the marquee programs. The Big Ten embodies steadiness and depth. The are the conferences in college basketball that are shaped by their competition in and out of conference play.\nWhile a high number of double-digit scorers can correlate with success, it is clear that a variety of factors, including defense, depth, and overall team chemistry are needed for success in the long run in college basketball. The Big East and Big Ten both highlight how competitive conferences can thrive with diverse strategies and player contributions.\nThese two conferences exemplify two different and distinct paths to success in the sport of college basketball. Both conferences remain pillars of the sport, producing thrilling matchups, rivalries, and elite talent. Whether it is balanced scoring or a more star-driven approach, the road to March requires far more than points on a scoreboard. Every possession counts."
