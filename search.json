    "section": "",
    "text": "The Big East is regarded as one of the the most competitive conferences in all of college basketball. Major powerhouses like UCONN and Villanova have won the NCAA tournament in 4 of the last 8 years. One question that often arises within the conference is whether the teams with balanced scoring, tend to perform better than teams relying on one or two star athletes. The correlation between scoring balance and success within the Big East is something we can determine, with a focus on how many players score in double figures and its impact on win percentage.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔
